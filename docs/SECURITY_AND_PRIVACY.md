# Security and Privacy Requirements

## Data classification
- **Public:** published listings, public service descriptions, articles, public contact channels.
- **Internal:** operational notes, unpublished content, staff procedures.
- **Confidential:** client inquiries, case notes, seller evidence, ownership documents, identity documents, inspection reports.
- **Restricted secrets:** passwords, tokens, private keys, signing keys, recovery codes.

## Mandatory controls
- TLS for data in transit and provider-supported encryption at rest.
- Private object storage for confidential documents; no public bucket or permanent public URL.
- Short-lived, scoped download links after server-side authorization.
- MFA for privileged staff; strong password/session controls.
- Role- and assignment-based access, deny by default.
- Audit logs for access, upload, download, sharing, role changes, exports, and deletion.
- File type/size validation, malware scanning where feasible, safe storage names, and download headers.
- Rate limiting, input validation, CSRF protections where applicable, secure cookies, and abuse monitoring.
- Secrets stored in managed environment configuration, never in Git.
- Data minimization, retention schedule, secure deletion, and client request handling.
- Backups encrypted and access-controlled; restore tests recorded.
- Incident response, breach assessment, notification, and credential rotation procedure.

## Cross-border considerations
Overseas clients may access their own case information from abroad. Hosting location, vendor subprocessors, cross-border transfer, and applicable legal obligations must be reviewed before choosing providers.

## Development rules
Use synthetic data only. Redact logs. Do not attach client documents to GitHub issues or pull requests. Keep public property media separate from private evidence.
